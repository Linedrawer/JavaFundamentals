Java Fundamentals - Homework 2
===========

This project is **Homework 2** for the [Java Fundamentals](https://courses.cs.ttu.ee/pages/ITI8905) course.

Homework assignment
-------------------
Implement the method ```getWords(filename)``` in class ```Homework2```. Do not change the method signature.

Find five most used words in a file. Treat words in case insensitive manner and skip one-letter words. Implementation must use the stream API and lambdas.

You can use the following snippet to read lines:

```java
Files.lines(Paths.get("lorem-ipsum.txt"))
```

Additional tips:
* Consider edge cases!
* Add more unit tests 
* must work with any file, not only lorem-ipsum.txt
* punctuation matters
* format your code!


Trouble with environment?
